<h2>GAME RULES</h2>
1. Don't be an asshole. This is the common sense rule and yall should understand it by now
2. Feel free to metagame or powergame to your hearts content - we really don't care, this is more or less a sandboxy-event server
3. Dont beg for game master over OOC, or for special privileges - ahelp it if you want some fun in the round!
we will more than happily oblige
just dont scream it over OOC
4. DONT GRIEF. This sorta falls under rule 1 but I just want to mention it - we're fine with fucking around with chemistry and toxins but dont blow shit up or kill people for no reason.
